## For Fabric📜

An open-source modpack that improves the overall UX and the game's performance and visuals, while staying true to the vanilla Minecraft experience.

While most performance-focused modpacks aim at higher FPS, this modpack focuses on optimizing the UX and stability, as well.

The modpack does not provide any QoL or OptiFine-parity mods, but some deliberately-selected mods to boost your gaming experience! Besides these optimization mods, the modpack also provides some essentials, like No Chat Reports.

You are expected to add any non-optimization mods you want, yourself. If you face any issues, you are free to ask for help on our Discord server.

All optimizations in the modpack are based on [**OptimimFuse**](https://modrinth.com/modpack/optimum-fuse).

If you find a bug or want to suggest any feature, you can issue a [**🐞Bug Report | 💡Suggestion**](https://github.com/Royal5074/xtremely-optimized/issues/new/choose). Alternatively, we have a [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/2sEahV9TXK) server.
